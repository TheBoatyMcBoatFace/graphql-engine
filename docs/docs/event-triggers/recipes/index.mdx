# Recipes

## Introduction

This section contains recipes for common use cases of **Event Triggers**. Each recipe is a succinct, tested, and
reusable piece of code that can be used to solve a common use case. However, these recipes are not exhaustive and you
can use them as a starting point to build your own custom logic.

### Moderate user content with ChatGPT

A common use case for integrating AI-powered bots into applications is to take care of mundane tasks like moderating
user content. This can be done with specialized sentiment analysis tool or a general large language model like [ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt).  This recipe shows how to use ChatGPT to moderate reviews
submitted by users. We'll build a webhook that parses Event Trigger data, sends it to ChatGPT, and then performs
operations on our data based on the results. [Check it out](/event-triggers/recipes/moderate-user-content-with-gpt.mdx)!
